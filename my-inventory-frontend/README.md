```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/it-illyria/react-interview-task.git
```

Backend (JSON Server):

- Start the JSON Server with a specific database file:

```bash
  npm server
```

- Access the JSON Server at http://localhost:5000/jobSites.

### Setup

      ```bash
      cd my-inventory-frontend
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Test

This project uses **`Jest`** for unit and integration testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

   - Run all tests in the project using:
      ```bash
      npm test 
      ```
     
   - Run tests in watch mode for active development:
      ```bash
      npm test -- --watch
      ```
   - To check test coverage:
      ```bash
       npm test -- --coverage
      ```
This will generate a `coverage` directory containing an HTML report of the coverage.
